# Álvaro Matsuda
Data Scientist

I'm studying Data Science since 2020 and I have experience doing Data Science projects. At the moment I work at Urban Systems as a Junior Business Research and I'm transitioning to Data Science. Currently, studying MBA Analytics - Artificial Inteligence at Fundação Instituto de Administração (FIA).

I have mastery all stages of developing a business solution using concepts and tools of Data Science, from understanding the business going throgh Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building models to publishing the model in production using Clouds.

I have developed solution for important business problems such as forecasting store sales and disease detection.

**Analytical Tools:**

- **Data Processing and Analysis:** Python, R, Excel.
- **Development:** Git, Linux.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Classification, Regression.
- **Machine Learning Deployment:** Heroku, Streamlit.

# Data Science Projects
[**Sales Forecast**](https://github.com/AlvaroMatsuda/Rossmann_Sales_Prediction)

Building a Machine Learning model to predict sales up to six weeks in advance makes easier and more accurate financial planning to the company.

In this project, I developed a regression Machine Learning model able to predict sales up to six weeks in advance for each individual store with **11% of error** for more than 1,000 stores. With this, I was able to show the **best scenario and worst scenario of sales** for each store, making the decision to allocate budget and financial planning easier.

[**Cardiovascular Disease Detection**](https://github.com/AlvaroMatsuda/Cardio_Catch_Diseases)

The objective of this project was to implement a classification model to predict cardiovascular disease at early stages to help improve the precision and time taken to do the diagnoses and increasing the profit of the company.

With the model, the precision of the diagnoses improved 15%, from 60% to 75%. Given that the company charges based on the precision of the diagnoses, the model could increase the profit per diagnosis by R$ 1.500,00 in average.
