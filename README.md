I have mastery of all stages of developing a business solution using concepts and tools of Data Science, from understandong the business going throgh Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building models to publishing the model in production using Clouds.

I have developed solution for important business problems such as forecasting store sales.

# Data Science Projects
**Sales Forecast**
Building a Machine Learning model to predict sales up to six weeks in advance makes easier and more accurate financial planning to the company.
In this project, I developed a regression Machine Learning model able to predict sales up to six weeks in advance for each individual store with **11% of error** for more than 1,000 stores. With this, I was able to show the **best and worst case scenario of sales** for each store, making the decision to allocate budget and financial planning easier.
