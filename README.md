# √Ålvaro Matsuda
Data Scientist

I'm studying Data Science since November/2020 and I have experience doing Data Science projects. At the moment I work at Urban Systems as a Junior Business Research and I'm transitioning to Data Science.

I have mastery of all stages of developing a business solution using concepts and tools of Data Science, from understandong the business going throgh Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building models to publishing the model in production using Clouds.

I have developed solution for important business problems such as forecasting store sales.

**Analytical Tools:

- **Data Processing and Analysis:** Python, R, Excel.
- **Development:** Git, Linux.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Classification, Regression.
- **Machine Learning Deployment:** Heroku, Streamlit.

# Data Science Projects
[**Sales Forecast**](https://github.com/AlvaroMatsuda/Rossman_Sales_Prediction)

Building a Machine Learning model to predict sales up to six weeks in advance makes easier and more accurate financial planning to the company.

In this project, I developed a regression Machine Learning model able to predict sales up to six weeks in advance for each individual store with **11% of error** for more than 1,000 stores. With this, I was able to show the **best scenario and worst scenario of sales** for each store, making the decision to allocate budget and financial planning easier.
